# Docploy Action

Docploy is a "docs-as-code" platform built to apply software engineering devops practices to your documentation. It works with your continuous integration platform to do the following:

- Deploys your docploy/docs/ folder onto its own dedicated site
- Tests your code snippets to make sure they are always working
- Enforces a consistent style guide (coming soon)
- Recommends grammar and syntax (coming soon)

We make it easy to build and maintain your documentation so you can guarantee a high quality developer experience.

You can save your developers' time because they will no longer need to perform routine checks to make sure how-to instructions are still valid. You can save your users' time because they won't need to scratch their head wondering if they did something wrong when they run an outdated code snippet.
